# Installing PyTorch From Source

These steps guide you through the process of building and installing PyTorch from its' source code.

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment
conda activate handwritingBCI

# Run this script to install package dependencies
./run.sh

# Clone the PyTorch repository
git clone --recursive https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch
cd pytorch

# Build PyTorch from the source code
python setup.py build

# Install the built PyTorch package
python setup.py install
```

To ensure PyTorch has been successfully installed, you can verify by running Python in the virtual environment.

```bash
# Start a Python session - ensure it's within the virtual environment
python3

# Inside the Python session, import PyTorch
>>> import torch
```
